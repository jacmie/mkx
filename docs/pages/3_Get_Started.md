@section p_3_1  3.1 Hardware Keypass

<div style="margin-left: 100px;">
  <img width=800 src="KeyPass_keyboard.jpg">
</div>

This simple setup uses an unmodified *Seeed Xiao RP2040* connected to a computer via USB.
<br>

To make it more useful and entertaining, we simulate the behavior of a hardware security key.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** *This is not intended for real security purposes. Actual hardware keys use encryption and have more advanced mechanisms.*
<br>

By bridging pin D5 (sending pin) and pin D6 (receiving pin) with pliers or any other conductive object like a wire, paper clip, etc. predefined key string is sent to the computer.

This setup uses only one hardware component, which acts as both the signal sender and the central processing unit.  
For this reason **PeripheryCentral** is defined and added to the keyboard object. Each peripheral device also requires an interface, here **InterphaceCentral** is added to fulfill that role.

Standard keyboard keys were used, modifier key **M_LSFT** was applied to produce capital letters and special characters.  
All input is grouped under a single key called **HK**, defined as a sequence **SEQ** key.  
The keymap is simple and consists of only one key: **HK**.

@section p_3_2  3.2 Booster Keyboard

<div style="margin-left: 100px;">
  <img width=800 src="BOOSTER_keyboard.jpg">
</div>

Here is a more practical example using a split keyboard called **Booster**.

Both halves of the keyboard use the *Pimoroni PGA2040* board, chosen for its small footprint, numerous available GPIO pins, and minimal onboard extras.

In the image, you can see:
- hot swap choc keys sockets
- development wiring on the right half, connecting it to USB for programming.
- loop between the sending and receiving pins used for debugging the UART connection.
- USB magnetic connector soldered to the left half, intended for regular usage.
- status RGB LED glowing green, indicating the currently active layer.

The keyboard runs slightly modified [Workman layout](https://workmanlayout.org/) and supports various types of keys, including **media keys**.

In terms of architecture:
- The left half functions as the **PeripheryCentral**
- The right half functions as the **PeripheryUART**

These peripheries are designed solely to send signals to the central processor using a defined protocol.

The left half also contains the **Interphaces** for both sides, managing communication between the **central** unit and each **periphery**.

The **status LED** indicates the active layer:
- Green for Layer 1
- Blue for Layer 2

Additionally, a few shortcut keys are defined, which are referenced later in the keymap.

@section p_3_3  3.3 Square Keyboard

<div style="margin-left: 100px;">
  <img src="SQ_keyboard.jpg">
</div>

Another split keyboard example, called **Sq (Square)**, is equipped with *Feather ESP32-S3* boards on both halves.  
This board provides several advantages, including potential Bluetooth connectivity, battery support, and onboard charging capabilities.

Since many parts of the code are shared with the Booster keyboard, this overview will focus only on the key differences.

The left half, which connects to the computer, includes a new file: **boot.py**.  
This script runs immediately when the board powers on, allowing configuration of USB device properties.

This includes:
- defining the keyboard's USB type and name
- disabling auto-reload on file save or system glitches, improving stability during everyday use
- preventing the board from appearing as a mass storage device, which is important for cybersecurity policies in some workplaces

To re-enable the storage device mode, a specific key (wired to source and sense pins) must be held down while powering on the board.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** *Always back up your code before disabling the storage feature. Incorrect pin configuration or other errors can make the board unresponsive.  
In such cases, a hard reset may be required, which erases all data and necessitates re-uploading your code.*

Additional Features:
- **RGB backlighting**: the keyboard has a slowly glowing rainbow effect across its keys
- **VIM emulation**: the keyboard can simulate VIM editor behavior using a custom **keys_vim** configuration

Each keyboard layer corresponds to a different **VIM mode**, indicated by the **status LED**.  
Even if you're not a VIM fan, you may find some picked *vim_keys* useful in your own keymap.  
Theoretically, this behavior can work even in text input fields of a browser üòâ
