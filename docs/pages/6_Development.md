To add functionality, inherit from the **Abstract** classes if possible, and use them like the already implemented functions and keys.  

@section p_6_2 Build with mpy

```
python build.py compile
python build.py upload
python build.py clean
```

## Code rules
- keep files structure flat
- place the library on board in the default CIRCUITPYTHON/lib
